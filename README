A repository for my simple text based game The Maze of the Assassins.

This game is available in either a command line (assassins.py) or a 
web application version (wsgiassassins.py). 

This simple game is an ongoing attempt to try out my Python skills 
and show them off. The web application version uses a Bootstrap 
template to be accessible to both desktop and mobile users. 

Future iterations of the project will hopefully include many more 
rooms, images of the scenes, a 'decision' tracker, and improved 
aesthetics. 

If you would like to play the game in your terminal, please download 
the assassins.py file. Save in a directory of your choosing and open 
a terminal to that directory. Enter the following command: 

python assassins.py

and the game will begin running in your terminal.

Please enjoy and if you have any questions or comments you can contact 
me through my CV website: www.MoriahSherman.com.
